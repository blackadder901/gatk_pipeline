Hello!

I hope you were able to donwload, install and run the tool I created!

Some notes for future updates:

- I believed that hardcoding a number of file names (reference_genome, SAM, BAM..) was the right thing to do but apparently that maybe was a mistake from my side, because make the pipeline less flexible. I need to change that in the future.

- I noticed last minute that I should have created some more safety cases. Sometimes when files are not valid in the right form like SAM and BAM, the tool complains.

- Become better in creating tests

- Tests, tests, tests, tests ....
